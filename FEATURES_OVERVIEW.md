# Booksy Features, Pain Points, and Rationale

## Overview

Booksy helps small businesses and freelancers manage income, expenses, invoices, and payables in one place, with AI-powered insights and automation.

## Feature-to-Pain-Point Mapping

### 1) Dashboard Overview

**Pain point:** Owners lack a clear, real-time view of financial health, leading to reactive decisions.

**Why it’s needed:** A unified dashboard surfaces key KPIs (income, expenses, cash balance, profit) so decisions are faster and more informed.

### 2) Transaction Management

**Pain point:** Manual tracking is slow and error-prone, especially when transactions come from multiple sources.

**Why it’s needed:** Structured transaction entry with categories and notes creates accurate, searchable records for reporting and decision-making.

### 3) Ledger View

**Pain point:** Historical transactions are hard to audit or review in spreadsheets.

**Why it’s needed:** A filterable ledger provides traceability and simplifies reconciliation.

### 4) Categories & Classification

**Pain point:** Without consistent categorization, spending analysis becomes meaningless.

**Why it’s needed:** Default categories and custom categories ensure consistency and better analytics.

### 5) Multi‑Currency + Currency Converter

**Pain point:** Cross-border transactions complicate reporting and profitability analysis.

**Why it’s needed:** Converting to a base currency makes financial reporting coherent and comparable.

### 6) Invoices

**Pain point:** Small businesses juggle scattered invoicing tools or manual templates.

**Why it’s needed:** Built-in invoicing keeps billing tied to financial records and improves cash flow visibility.

### 7) Invoice Items Catalog

**Pain point:** Repeated line items are time-consuming to recreate.

**Why it’s needed:** A reusable catalog speeds up invoice creation and ensures pricing consistency.

### 8) Payments Tracking

**Pain point:** Businesses lose track of what’s been paid and what’s overdue.

**Why it’s needed:** Payment status tracking improves collections and forecasting.

### 9) To‑Pay (Accounts Payable)

**Pain point:** Bills and vendor payments are often missed or paid late.

**Why it’s needed:** A payables list with calendar views helps schedule payments and avoid late fees.

### 10) Receipts & OCR

**Pain point:** Manual receipt entry wastes time and causes mistakes.

**Why it’s needed:** OCR reduces data entry and improves accuracy of expense records.

### 11) Business Health

**Pain point:** Owners lack early warning signals for financial risk.

**Why it’s needed:** Health metrics and alerts surface issues early for proactive action.

### 12) AI Assistant & Insights

**Pain point:** Non-accountants struggle to interpret financial data.

**Why it’s needed:** AI summarizes trends and answers questions in plain language.

### 13) Notifications

**Pain point:** Important events (due dates, anomalies) are easy to miss.

**Why it’s needed:** Notifications keep users informed and reduce operational risk.

### 14) Secure Authentication & RLS

**Pain point:** Financial data needs strict access controls.

**Why it’s needed:** Supabase Auth and RLS protect sensitive business data and enforce tenancy.

## Summary

Each feature targets a specific operational pain point faced by small businesses. Together, they reduce manual work, improve financial clarity, and enable proactive decision-making.
